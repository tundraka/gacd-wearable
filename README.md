Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project - Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

# Scripts

There are two scripts that will perform the points that were requested in the
project.

These scripts require the data in `https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip`,
the script `run_analysis.R` won't download and unzip the data, it should be
alredy place under the `data` directory.

- run_analysis.R
- subset_analysis.R

#### run_analysis.R
This script will look download the data file, unzip it and read it. In order to
execute this script, you can enter the R terminal and type:

```R
source('run_analysis.R')
```

Another way would be in your bash console.

```R
Rscript run_analysis.R
```

And the tidy data set will be located under `clean/data.csv`. The data
definition is contained in `CodeBook.md`.

#### subset_analysis.R
This script will take the data generated by the previous script and calculate
the mean of every feature divided by the activity and subject.

**NOTE**: This script will fail if the `run_analysis.R` hasn't generated the
data.

In the R console do:
```R
source('subset_analysis.R')
```

The output will be place in `clean/subset.csv'.
